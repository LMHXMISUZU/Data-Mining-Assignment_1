# Data-Mining-Assignment-1

For this assignment I assumed the role of a data analyst and was asked to provide a professional, written report for the following case study.

"Civitas Motors is an independent used car dealership based in Worcestershire, selling a range of cars, from small hatchbacks to high-end sports cars. Since they originally opened in Worcester in 2000, they have experienced steady growth and opened a dealership in Kidderminster in 2010 and are looking to open a new dealership in Evesham. David Dec, the dealer principle, has asked you to analyse their database and produce a written report that addresses the following:

•	What are the age ranges of their customers?
•	On average, how frequently are people changing their cars?
•	How many customers do they currently have in the WR10 and WR11 postcode areas?
This should be broken down in the follow:
1.	Total number of customers in these postcode areas
2.	The ages of these customers
3.	The total value of the vehicles
4.	The average value of the vehicles, accounting for outliers
•	What is the level of vehicle sales over a fiscal year?

In addition, they would like to know which of their current marketing method is producing the best Return on Investment (ROI). They currently do the following: online advertising with Google and Facebook, mailshot marketing to prospective customers and advertising in the Worcester News. Based on the analysis they would like to select the best 2 methods to promote the new dealership. You will need to apply two regression models and evaluate their performance within your report."

I was required to write a professional report which outlines my methods, findings and uses appropriate visualisations to support the analysis. I outlined why the methods applied were suited to the analysis and how effective they were at providing the results. 

I also needed to provide a Jupyter Notebook which contains all of your code used for the analysis as well as all data.
